My business card harvests power in the air transmitted by phones, and sends a link to this site with Near Field Communication (NFC) technology. Here's how I did it. I didn't want to buy a stack of business cards that I would hand out. The problem may arise that some information changed and I would have to buy a new set of cards. 

In classic Engineer fashion, I decided to fix this minor problem by designing and manufacturing a complex solution. complete Printed Circuit Board (PCB) solution that uses the NFC protocol to transmit data with phones that tap my card. The Electromagnetic Field emitted from the phone is then harvested and used to light up an LED on the card. Background NFC reading is growing in popularity and the technology exists in all Android phones and iPhones starting at iPhone 10.
